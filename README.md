### How to use the flashcards

#### TEX files

These flashcards are formatted to be used with [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), the digital flashcard software.

1. Download [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).
2. Make sure you have LaTeX installed on your computer. 
3. Select the deck you want the cards to be in (or create a new one and select it). 
4. Import the `.tex` file:
    - Go to File -> Import. You should see this window:
    - Select the `.tex` file you want to import.
    - You should see an Anki screen with import options that looks like this:  ![How to import tex files to Anki](how_to_anki.png)
        - 1 Select the LaTeX card type by clicking on the field to the right of Type.
            - If you don't have this card type, create one (see 'How to create LaTeX Card Type' below).
            - If you do, you will 99% still have to edit the header of the card type to accommodate for the conditional independence symbols in `lecture-05.tex`. (Step 5 of 'How to create LaTeX Card Type' below.)
        - 2 Choose to have fields separated by a semicolon (; char).
            - You should now have two fields in the file.
        - 3 Choose to update existing notes when the first field matches (optional but is generally a good idea).
    - Click 'Import'.
    - There may be some error messages - most of them don't matter but let me know if you see a proper error.
5. Click on the name of the deck and click 'Study Now' to start reviewing the flashcards! :)

#### How to create a LaTeX card type

1. From the Anki launch page, click 'Add'. If you are already in a window where you can select the card type, skip this step.
2. Click on the card type.
3. You should see a list of card types. Click 'Manage'.
4. Click 'Add'.
5. Click 'Clone: Basic' and name the card type as 'LaTeX' (or whatever else you want). (Or if you don't have Basic, cloning another card type should also work - Basic is just the most basic (!) card type.) 
6. Select the card type you just created. Click 'Options' and add the following to the header:
    ```
    \documentclass[12pt]{article} 
    \usepackage{amssymb,amsmath,amsfonts,mathrsfs, graphicx} 
    \usepackage[paperwidth=5in, paperheight=100in]{geometry} % you probably don't need this but I haven't tested removing it
    \newcommand{\indep}{\perp\!\!\!\perp}

    \newcommand{\CI}{\mathrel{\text{\scalebox{1.07}{$\perp\mkern-10mu\perp$}}}}

    \newcommand{\nCI}{\centernot{\CI}}
    \begin{document} 
    ```
    - If you already have a header, you can add the following if you plan to import  Unsupervised Learning Lecture 5 (Graphical models):
    ```\newcommand{\indep}{\perp\!\!\!\perp}

    \newcommand{\CI}{\mathrel{\text{\scalebox{1.07}{$\perp\mkern-10mu\perp$}}}}

    \newcommand{\nCI}{\centernot{\CI}}
    ```
    - Add the following footer:
    ```\end{document}```
7. You should be back where you are choosing a card type. (To get to this window, click on the card type name from the window where you are adding cards.) Click on your new card type and click 'Choose.'
8. Click 'Cards...'. You should see something like: 
    - ![Card layout in Anki](latex_card.png)
10. Replace the front template with
    - ```[latex]{{Front}}[/latex] ```
    - and the back template with
    ```
    [latex]{{Front}}[/latex]

    <br /><br />
    <hr id=answer>
    <br />

    [latex]{{Back}}[/latex] 
    ```
9. Click 'Close'. You're done! Just select this card type when you're importing cards in future.
